- üëã Hi, this is the profile for the ACTIONr project
- üëÄ ACTIONr is a research project funded by the EU, under HORIZON-WIDERA-2021-ACCESS-03
- üìÖ The ACTIONr project will be running from November 2022 until October 2025
- ‚ö° Fun fact: Did you know that 50-70% of the nitrogen applied in the fields through fertilisation is lost as nitrate and N-oxides, raising agricultural production costs and contributing to environmental pollution 
and climate change?
- üéØ The ultimate goal of ACTIONr is to establish new tools and pathways to optimise Nitrogen Use Efficiency, decelerate the nitrogen cycle and decrease the environmental footprint of reactive nitrogen
- üß™ ACTIONr aims to investigate the complex interactions of nitrification inhibitors (NIs) with nitrogen cycling microbial players at different experimental scales, from in vitro assays with single organisms, to synthetic microbial communities of nitrifiers and eventually to natural soil microbial assemblages. Its research objectives are:
  - a) to identify the mode of action of NIs at cellular level
  - b) to develop and use synthetic microbial communities of nitrifiers as an ecologically relevant tool for NI activity screening
  - c) to develop experimental tools to assess the activity and effects of NIs on ammonia oxidising microorganisms and off target microorganisms participating or not in N cycling, as well as to address the reciprocal effects on greenhouse gas emissions
  - d) to gather all experimental data in support of the development and validation of novel, safer and more efficient NIs
- üåê In ACTIONr, the University of Thessaly and the [Plant and Environmental Biotechnology Laboratory](https://github.com/PlantEnvLab) are twinning with the University of Vienna and √âcole Centrale de Lyon, aiming to cooperate experimentally, while also implementing a well-designed plan of training, technology transfer, networking, and dissemination, communication and exploitation (DEC) activities. These include bi-directional 
staff exchanges, on-site training, summer schools, thematic workshops and symposia on nitrification and related processes, networking fora on protocols and tools standardization, integrated PhD programs, and a 
diverse set of DEC measures directed towards the scientific community, potential stakeholders, and local communities.
- üñ•Ô∏è This github profile is a part of the ACTIONr educational/scientific platform, where we provide technical or theoretical educational and/or scientific material, produced through the training and technology 
transfer activities of the project, as well as links to other relevant platforms and material. In this profile, you can find repositories with coding scripts and tutorials developed by members and affiliates of 
the project, that can help you tackle data analysis for many experimental pipelines relative to ammonia oxidisers and nitrification inhibitors
